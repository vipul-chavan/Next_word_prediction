# Next_word_prediction
###Next Word Prediction with TensorFlow and Streamlit
####This project implements a Next Word Prediction model using TensorFlow and provides a simple user interface using Streamlit. The model is trained to predict the next word in a sequence of text based on pre-existing data.

###Features
####Next Word Prediction Model: Utilizes a pre-trained TensorFlow model for predicting the next word in a given text sequence.
Streamlit UI: Implements a user-friendly interface with Streamlit, allowing users to input text and receive predictions.
Easy Deployment: Streamlit makes it easy to deploy and share the application without the need for complex setups.
Usage
Clone the repository.
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (tensorflow, streamlit).
Run the Streamlit app with streamlit run your_script_name.py.
Feel free to explore and contribute to enhance the capabilities of the model or improve the user interface!
