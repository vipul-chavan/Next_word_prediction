# Next Word Prediction with TensorFlow and Streamlit
This project implements a Next Word Prediction model using TensorFlow and provides a simple user interface using Streamlit. The model is trained to predict the next word in a sequence of text based on pre-existing data.

# Features

Next Word Prediction Model: Utilizes a pre-trained TensorFlow model for predicting the next word in a given text sequence.
Streamlit UI: Implements a user-friendly interface with Streamlit, allowing users to input text and receive predictions.
Easy Deployment: Streamlit makes it easy to deploy and share the application without the need for complex setups.

# Usage

1] Clone the repository.
2] Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (tensorflow, streamlit).
3] Run the Streamlit app with streamlit run main.py.

Feel free to explore and contribute to enhance the capabilities of the model or improve the user interface!
